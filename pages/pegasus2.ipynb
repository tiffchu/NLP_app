Currently, I am a fourth-year student at SFU (based in Burnaby, BC), and I am studying\\npsychology and education! I see that you're interested in working with kids. That's awesome! I\\nactually work with kids aged 3–6 on the autism spectrum. If you have any questions about working\\nwith children, or just want to talk about what you're passionate about, then please, feel free to\\nask or discuss with me! I really hope we get to know each other better, and have an awesome\\nexperience toegether.\""
